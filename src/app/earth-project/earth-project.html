        Develop a responsive web application to manage and optimize user learning via digital flashcards. 
        The project requires building a RESTful API to perform all CRUD operations on user-defined card 
        sets and integrating a database (e.g., PostgreSQL or SQLite) for persistent storage. The central
         challenge is implementing Spaced Repetition Logic on the backend to dynamically schedule card 
         reviews based on user performance, demonstrating strong skills in API development, business logic, 
         and full-stack data management.
